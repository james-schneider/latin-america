        The picture above is of my fourth grade class where I volunteered as an English teacher
        in San Pedro La Laguna, Solol√°. I lived in Guatemala for six months while I studied
        Spanish in an immersion program at the <a href="http://cooperativeschoolsanpedro.edu.gt/"

        (<cite>Cooperative Spanish School</cite>).
        You can see that the girls still wear traditional clothing while the boys have adopted
        a popular style of the modern West. The culture is interesting and they have the
        best coffee I've ever tasted in my life.

    <h2>My Experience in Guatemala</h2>
    <p>My first trip to Guatemala was in 2013.  I studied at a Spanish immersion school for three
      weeks.  I studies six hours per day.  It was intense and I learned a lot.  However, I was slightly
      disappointed in my progress.  I mistakenly thought I would be able to speak fluently
      after three weeks.  This is a mistake that many people make when learning a second language.  It's
      easy to take for granted how much is involved in learning a language.  In addition to all of the 
      grammar and vocabulary, there are so many nuances that can take years to understand.
    </p>

    <p>I returned to Guatemala in 2014 for six months!  At the end of the six months I started to get really
      comfortable speaking Spanish.  But was I really fluent?  What does it mean to be fluent?
    </p>

    <p class="definition"><strong>Fluent</strong> - able to speak or write a particular foreign 
      language easily, accurately, and articulately.
    </p>
      
    <p>Not everyone uses the word <cite>fluent</cite> in the same way. To some it means being able to
    hold a conversation. To others it means to truly express yourself and discuss any topic with ease--something many people
    find difficult in their native language!
